## Getting Started

**(Instructions will vary depending on the implementation. Replace the following with actual instructions.)**

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Install via pip (example)
   pip install readmegen
   ```

2. **Initialization:**
   ```bash
   readmegen init
   ```
   This will create a configuration file (`readmegen.yaml` or similar) where you can specify project details and customize the generated README.

3. **Generation:**
   ```bash
   readmegen generate
   ```
   This will create a `README.md` file in your project's root directory.
